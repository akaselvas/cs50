# AI-Powered Tarot Reading Application

This Flask application provides a web interface for Tarot card readings using AI-generated interpretations, specifically leveraging Google's Gemini Pro model.  It offers a user-friendly experience with interactive card selection and real-time chat functionality for deeper exploration of the reading.

## Features

* **AI-Generated Readings:**  Provides insightful Tarot readings based on user intention and selected cards, powered by Google's Gemini Pro.
* **Interactive Card Selection:** Users can visually select their cards from a randomized spread.
* **Real-Time Chat:** Integrates a chat interface powered by SocketIO, allowing users to ask follow-up questions and delve deeper into their reading.  The AI chatbot utilizes the context of the generated reading to provide relevant responses.
* **Secure and Robust:**  Implements various security measures, including CSRF protection, rate limiting, and robust Content Security Policy (CSP) with nonces.  Utilizes server-side sessions stored in Redis for enhanced security and scalability.
* **Easy Deployment:** Designed for easy deployment with clear environment variable configuration.


## Technical Details

* **Framework:** Flask
* **AI Model:** Google Gemini Pro (gemini-1.5-pro-002)
* **Real-Time Communication:** SocketIO
* **Session Management:** Flask-Session with Redis backend
* **Rate Limiting:** Flask-Limiter with Redis backend
* **Security:** Flask-Talisman, Flask-WTF (CSRF Protection)
* **Markdown Rendering:** Markdown, Markupsafe
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript


## Libraries and Their Purpose

This application utilizes several key libraries:

* **Flask:** The core web framework for building the application.
* **google.generativeai:**  Provides access to Google's Gemini Pro AI model for generating Tarot readings and chat responses.
* **SocketIO:** Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server for the chat functionality.
* **Flask-Session & Redis:**  Manages server-side sessions, storing them in Redis for improved security and scalability.
* **Flask-Limiter & Redis:** Implements rate limiting to prevent abuse, using Redis as the storage backend.
* **Flask-WTF:** Provides CSRF protection to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
* **Flask-Talisman:** Sets important security headers, including Content Security Policy (CSP), to mitigate various attack vectors.
* **Markdown & Markupsafe:**  Used for rendering Markdown-formatted text into HTML safely.
* **json:**  Handles JSON encoding and decoding for data exchange.
* **secrets & os:** Used for generating cryptographically secure random numbers and interacting with the operating system for environment variables.
* **logging:**  Provides logging capabilities for debugging and monitoring.


## Security Measures

Security is a primary concern in this application.  Several measures are implemented to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

* **CSRF Protection (Flask-WTF):**  Protects against cross-site request forgery attacks by using CSRF tokens.
* **Rate Limiting (Flask-Limiter):**  Limits the number of requests a user can make within a given timeframe to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.  Uses Redis for distributed rate limiting.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Flask-Talisman):**  Implements a strong CSP with nonces to mitigate XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks. This restricts the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of injected malicious scripts.
* **Server-Side Sessions (Flask-Session & Redis):**  Stores session data securely on the server-side using Redis, preventing client-side tampering.
* **Secure Session Management:**  Uses a cryptographically secure secret key (`SECRET_KEY`) for signing session cookies, ensuring integrity and confidentiality.
* **Input Sanitization:**  Placeholder functions are provided for input sanitization.  **It is crucial to implement robust sanitization using a library like Bleach to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.** This will help prevent malicious code injection from user inputs.


## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tarot-reading-app.git
   cd tarot-reading-app
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```
   GENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY>
   SECRET_KEY=<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>  # Generate a strong secret key
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379  # Update if using a different Redis instance
   ```

5. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   Alternatively, for development with SocketIO:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Access the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
2. **Enter your intention:**  Provide a brief description of your focus for the reading.
3. **Select the number of cards:** Choose 1, 3, or 5 cards.
4. **Select Your Cards:** Click on the cards from the displayed sets to choose your reading.
5. **View your reading:** The AI-generated reading will be displayed on the results page.
6. **Use the chat:** Ask follow-up questions or clarifications related to your reading in the chat interface.

## Security Considerations

* **GENAI_API_KEY:**  Store your API key securely in the `.env` file and never expose it in your code repository.
* **SECRET_KEY:** Use a strong, randomly generated secret key for session signing.
* **Rate Limiting:**  Adjust the rate limits in `app.py` as needed to prevent abuse.
* **Input Sanitization:**  While a placeholder is provided, implement robust input sanitization to prevent potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS attacks).  Consider using a library like Bleach.
* **CSP Nonces:**  The application uses CSP nonces for enhanced security against XSS attacks.  Ensure this mechanism is correctly implemented and maintained.

## Future Enhancements

* **Improved Input Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive input sanitization for user-provided text.
* **User Authentication:**  Add user authentication to personalize readings and track history.
* **Expanded Card Database:** Include more Tarot decks and spreads.
* **Enhanced Chat Functionality:**  Improve the AI chatbot's understanding and response capabilities.
* **UI/UX Improvements:** Refine the user interface for a more engaging experience.
